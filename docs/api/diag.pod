=head1 NAME

diag, sysdiag - Report diagnostics in a TAP test case

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <tap/basic.h>

void B<diag>(const char *I<format>, ...);

void B<sysdiag>(const char *I<format>, ...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

diag() reports a diagnostic in a TAP test case.  I<format> must be a
printf-style format string with possible optional arguments stating the
fatal error encountered.  This function adds C<#> and a space to the
beginning of the formatted string and prints it, followed by a newline, to
standard output.

sysdiag() is identical to diag() except that it appends a colon, a space,
and the results of strerror() on the current value of B<errno> to the end
of the diagnostic.

These functions are useful for reporting supplemental information about
the progress of a test case or additional information about test failures.
The output will be ignored by a TAP test harness but can be reviewed by a
human analyzing what a test case is doing.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

None.

=head1 CAVEATS

Unlike most TAP library functions, I<format> in this case may not be NULL.
A diagnostic message must be provided.
