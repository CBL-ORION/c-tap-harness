                    User-Visible C TAP Harness Changes

C TAP Harness 1.0

    Initial public release based on the version of runtests.c and the
    libtest library that shipped with remctl 2.13.  The changes below are
    relative to that version.

    Set the SOURCE and BUILD environment variables when running tests to
    the roots of the source and build test directories if set at compile
    time or via the -s and -b command-line options to runtests.

    Search for test programs first in the current directory and then in
    the build and source directories, in that order, as specified by
    SOURCE and BUILD or by the -s and -b options.  This allows some tests
    to be compiled and some shipped with the package and merged together
    at run time by runtests, even if the build directory is not the source
    directory.

    Support running a single test program with the -o command-line option.
    This is mostly interesting to take advantage of the environment
    variables and test searching algorithm described above.

    Add support for 0..1 # skip <reason> plan lines, indicating that the
    entire test case should be skipped.

    Add support for aborting a test case with "Bail out!" and reporting
    the reason given on that line.

    Change the reporting of reasons to abort the test case to use ABORTED
    and the abort reason in parentheses for more consistent output.

    Rename test_init() to plan() and ok_int(), ok_double(), and
    ok_string() to is_int(), is_double(), and is_string() in the C TAP
    library to more closely match the function names in Perl's test
    modules.

    Add a bail() C TAP library function to bail out with the right magic
    output string.

    Stop exporting the printcount interface in the shell version of the
    TAP library.  Instead, provide plan, ok, skip, ok_block, skip_block,
    and ok_program shell functions, similar to the C library interface.

    Show mismatch output from the is_*() functions before the "not ok"
    line instead of after it.

    Add the initial "1.." to plan() output for better TAP compliance.

    Support either "-t" or ".t" as the ending of test cases.

    Remove the dependency on both config.h and the general portability
    framework and instead include the necessary C headers directly.  This
    requires ANSI C.

    Remove the functions from libtap that assume libutil from rra-c-util.
    Those library functions will be provided by that package.
