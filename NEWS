                    User-Visible C TAP Driver Changes

C Tap Driver 1.0

    Initial public release based on the version of runtests.c and the
    libtest library that shipped with remctl 2.13.  The changes below are
    relative to that version.

    Remove the dependency on both config.h and the general portability
    framework and instead include the necessary C headers directly.  This
    requires ANSI C.
