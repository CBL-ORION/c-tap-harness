                         C TAP Driver To-Do List

Protocol:

 * Support giving the plan at the end of the test suite instead of the
   beginning.  This will require dynamically tracking test results without
   pre-allocating space and then checking against the plan for missing
   tests at the end.

 * Support omitting the test number in "ok" and "not ok" lines.  The
   driver should maintain its own counter and increment with each test.

 * Support todo tests ("# todo" on the test line).  The driver should
   report such tests as successful if they're not ok and failure if
   they're ok (although probably with different detail).

 * Report the text after the "# skip" directive as the reason for the
   skipping of the test.  We should accumulate reasons and the count of
   tests that had that reason and report how many tests were skipped for
   each reason.

 * Support skipping the entire file with "1..0 # skip" (which seems to
   be a slightly different syntax).

 * If the test script prints "Bail out!" followed by some message, the
   test case should be aborted and the following reason reported as the
   reason for bailing out.

Extra Driver Features:

 * Support a verbose mode that shows the result of each test as it's
   running instead of just the test counts.

 * Support displaying diagnostic lines (lines beginning with "#") in a
   verbose mode.
