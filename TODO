                         C TAP Harness To-Do List

Protocol:

 * Report the text after the "# skip" directive as the reason for the
   skipping of the test.  We should accumulate reasons and the count of
   tests that had that reason and report how many tests were skipped for
   each reason.

 * Ignore an initial "TAP version <version>" string in the output for
   compliance with what's apparently the new TAP format.

Reporting:

 * Report passing todo tests as something other than simple failed tests.

 * Add an option to report test results in color.

Extra Harness Features:

 * Support a verbose mode that shows the result of each test as it's
   running instead of just the test counts.

 * Support displaying diagnostic lines (lines beginning with "#") in a
   verbose mode.

 * Support running selected tests under fakeroot, probably by adding a
   parameter in the TESTS file after the test name.

 * Support automatically finding test cases under a particular directory
   similar to how prove finds tests, without needing a TESTS file.
