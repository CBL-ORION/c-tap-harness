                    User-Visible C TAP Harness Changes

C TAP Harness 1.0

    Initial public release based on the version of runtests.c and the
    libtest library that shipped with remctl 2.13.  The changes below are
    relative to that version.

    Rename test_init() to plan() and ok_int(), ok_double(), and
    ok_string() to is_int(), is_double(), and is_string() in the C TAP
    library to more closely match the function names in Perl's test
    modules.

    Stop exporting the printcount interface in the shell version of the
    TAP library.  Instead, provide plan, ok, skip, ok_block, skip_block,
    and ok_program shell functions, similar to the C library interface.

    Show mismatch output from the is_*() functions before the "not ok"
    line instead of after it.

    Add the initial "1.." to plan() output for better TAP compliance.

    Support either "-t" or ".t" as the ending of test cases.

    Remove the dependency on both config.h and the general portability
    framework and instead include the necessary C headers directly.  This
    requires ANSI C.

    Remove the functions from libtap that assume libutil from rra-c-util.
    Those library functions will be provided by that package.
