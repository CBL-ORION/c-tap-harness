aclocal.m4, mkdepend, mkusage, include/librutil.h, replace/*.c,
util/concat.c, and the entirety of the test suite (including t/fakewrite.c
and t/xmalloc.c, but not including t/runtests.c) are in the public domain.
You may do anything you like with that code, although I would strongly
prefer that any improvements or modifications be sent to me
(rra@stanford.edu) so that I can continue to maintain a canonical version.

t/runtests.c, util/error.c, util/xmalloc.c, and util/xwrite.c are covered
by the following license:
