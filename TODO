                         C TAP Harness To-Do List

Protocol:

 * Support giving the plan at the end of the test suite instead of the
   beginning.  This will require dynamically tracking test results without
   pre-allocating space and then checking against the plan for missing
   tests at the end.

 * Report the text after the "# skip" directive as the reason for the
   skipping of the test.  We should accumulate reasons and the count of
   tests that had that reason and report how many tests were skipped for
   each reason.

Reporting:

 * Report passing todo tests as something other than simple failed tests.

 * Add an option to report test results in color.

Extra Harness Features:

 * Support a verbose mode that shows the result of each test as it's
   running instead of just the test counts.

 * Support displaying diagnostic lines (lines beginning with "#") in a
   verbose mode.

 * Support running selected tests under fakeroot, probably by adding a
   parameter in the TESTS file after the test name.

 * Support automatically finding test cases under a particular directory
   similar to how prove finds tests, without needing a TESTS file.

TAP Library:

 * Add a function for reporting diagnostic output that handles prepending
   the # character.
