=head1 NAME

skip, skip_block - Skip a TAP test

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <tap/basic.h>

void B<skip>(const char *I<reason>, ...);

void B<skip_block>(unsigned long I<count>, const char *I<reason>, ...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

skip() marks the next test as skipped.  I<reason> may be NULL; if not
NULL, I<reason> should be a printf-style format string with optional
additional arguments specifying the reason why the test was skipped.
Common reasons to skip tests include tests that are not applicable to the
current platform, environment, or software configuration options, and
tests that rely on optional test configuration that isn't present.

skip_block() is identical to skip() except that it marks the next I<count>
tests as skipped.

To skip an entire test case, call skip_all() before plan() or plan_lazy()
rather than using these functions.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

None.

=head1 CAVEATS

plan() or plan_lazy() should always be called before calling skip() or
skip_block().

=head1 SEE ALSO

ok(3), plan(3), skip_all(3)
